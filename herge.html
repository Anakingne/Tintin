    Hergé (Real name Georges Prosper Remi) was the creator, writer, and main cartoonist of The Adventures of Tintin. He created the very first Tintin-comic, Tintin in Soviet, in 1929, and continued making comics until his death in 1983. Hergé made 24 Tintin-comics in his lifetime, which became very popular, both in his home country of Belgium and abroad. The name Hergé is the french pronunciation of the letters RG, which were his initials backwards.
