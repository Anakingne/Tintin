    There are currently 5 video games based on Herg√©'s comics... and one more on the way!
    </ul></h2>
    <ul><h2>
    The very first video game was released all the way back in 1987! It was called Tintin on the Moon and it's genre a mixture of action and shoot 'em up/side scroller. It was published by Infogrames for the Amiga, Amstrad CDC, Atari ST, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. Probe Entertainment later converted it to MS-DOS in 1989.
    </ul></h2>
    <ul><h2>
    The second one - Tintin in Tibet - was made in 1995 and is a 2D platform game based on the comic with the same title. It was released for the Mega Drive, Game Boy, Game Gear, and the Super NES in 1995. In 1996 it was released for PC, and it was released for the Game Boy Color as late as in 2001!
    </ul></h2>
    <ul><h2>
    After that came Prisoners of the Sun, released in 1997 for the SNES, Game Boy and PC and in 2000 for the Game Boy Color. Like Tintin in Tibet, it was a 2D platform game and was published by the same company, Infogrames Multimedia.
    </ul></h2>
    <ul><h2>
    The 5th and latest release was The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn. It was based more on the movie with the same name rather than the comic. It was published by Ubisoft for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 3, Wii, Xbox 360 in 2011, and Symbian in 2012. Gameloft published the game for iOS and Android in 2011. Like the other games, it's an action/adventure platformer.
    </ul></h2>
    <ul><h2>
    In April of 2020, it was reported by several news outlets that the developer Microids was working on a new video game. The game will reportedly launch on PC as well as several consoles. As of now (2020-02-18) there isn't much detail avout the game, but one can hope!
