    	There are currenty 8 Tintin movies in the world. Two of them are documentaries, three are based on the comics, and the rest are original stories. Here's a small description of the movies, in order of release. I will not talk about the documentaries as I haven't seen them.

    <ul><h2>
    	The first movie was released in 1947 and is called The Crab with the Golden Claws ("Le crabe aux pinces d'or" in french). It's a stop-motion animation feature film based on the comic book with the same name, which it's extremely faithful to.

    	Tintin and the Golden Fleece (Tintin et le Mystère de La Toison d'or) released in 1961, and Tintin and the Blue Oranges (Tintin et les Oranges bleues) released in 1964, are the only two live-action Tintin movies to date. Both movies have relatively weak plots, but are still enjoyable. They star Jean-Pierre Talbot as Tintin in both movies and  Georges Wilson as Captain Haddock in the first movie and Jean Bouise as Haddock in the second movie.

    	Tintin and the Temple of the Sun (Tintin et le temple du soleil) was released in 1969. It was based on two comics: The Seven Crystal Balls and Prisoners of the Sun.
    </h2></ul>
    <ul><h2>
    	Tintin and the Lake of Sharks (French: Tintin et le lac aux requins) was released in 1972.. It is not based on the comics or even written by Hergé, but he did supervise it. It was later adapted into a comic using stills from the movie. It is generally considered to be one of the better adaptations.
